# Transcript

_Transcript_ is a library to convert various textual formats to an expressive Intermediate Representation (IR), a data structure used to represent the textual content. The IR is designed to be conducive for further processing, such as searching, modification, optimization and translation.

The IR can be exported to various formats. So while Transcript _can_ be used as a Rust implemented version of _Pandoc_, but is not intended to compete with that great tool.
